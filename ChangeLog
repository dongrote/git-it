v1.2
Added auto-stash functionality to `it push` and `it pull`
  - If changes are detected in the current working branch, the changes are
    silently stashed and popped back in order to perform the push/pull operation
`it new` checks that stdin is a tty before auto-launching the ticket editor
`it reject` now demands a rejection message

v1.1
Added `it assign` command to easy assigning of tickets to other users
`it new` asks to fill in the 'Assign to: ' field instead of 'Development time: '
`it new` immediately opens a ticket for editing after creating the ticket
`it edit` performs a lookup for the preferred editor in the following locations,
  in this exact order:
    - git config --local core.editor
    - git config --global core.editor
    - git config --system core.editor
    - $GIT_EDITOR
    - $EDITOR
    - 'nano'
`it rm` no longer requires '-f', nor does it appear to "hang" awaiting user input
git-it can now be installed globally using `sudo python setup.py install`
